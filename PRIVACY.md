# Privacy Policy for Remote Desktop Protocol Handler

**Effective Date: [2024-05-26]**

This Privacy Policy describes how the "Remote Desktop Protocol Handler" application ("the App") operates with respect to your privacy.

**We Do Not Collect Your Data**

The core function of the "Remote Desktop Protocol Handler" app is to act as a handler for Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) links. This means when you click on an RDP link, our App simply opens the default Windows Remote Desktop Connection client (`mstsc.exe`) with the provided RDP address.

**Our App itself does not collect, store, transmit, or process any personal information or data from your device or usage.** We do not use analytics, tracking, or any other mechanisms to gather information about you or your use of the App.

**Data Transmission via `mstsc.exe` (Windows Remote Desktop Connection)**

While our App does not collect data, launching `mstsc.exe` and connecting to a remote machine via RDP _does_ involve the transmission of data. The Windows Remote Desktop Connection client is a built-in Windows feature and operates according to its own privacy practices and settings, which are independent of our App.

When you use `mstsc.exe` to connect to a remote desktop, the following may occur:

- **Transmission of System Resources:** Depending on your settings and the configuration of the remote desktop session, `mstsc.exe` may transmit information or access resources from your local computer to the remote computer. This can include:
  - Clipboard contents
  - Local drives and printers
  - Audio and video playback
  - Smart card access
- **Input Data:** Your keyboard and mouse input are sent to the remote computer to control the session.
- **Display Data:** The visual output of the remote computer's desktop is sent back to your local computer for display.
- **Connection Metadata:** Information about the connection, such as the IP address of the remote server, may be exchanged.

**This data transmission is solely handled by `mstsc.exe` and the underlying RDP protocol. The "Remote Desktop Protocol Handler" App has no control over, nor does it access, this transmitted data.**

**Third-Party Remote Desktops**

When you connect to a remote desktop using `mstsc.exe`, you are connecting to a third-party system or network. The privacy practices and data handling of that third-party are governed by their own policies and agreements. You should review the privacy policy of the remote desktop service or system you are connecting to understand how they handle your data.

**Changes to This Privacy Policy**

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted on this page.
